Context: File AppDemo/Services/BookService.cs contains a method GetRecommendedBooks(Book book) // TODO

Task: Implement GetRecommendedBooks to return up to 5 books from a static in-memory list that share either the same author or a category with the input book. Keep deterministic ordering (sort by title).

Requirements:
- Perform a null check on the input and throw ArgumentNullException if null.
- Return an IEnumerable<Book> limited to 5 items.
- Add XML documentation comments and simple, readable code.

Return: the modified file content only and a one-line unit test demonstrating expected behavior.
