Goal: Add a new C# service that manages discounts for books.

Task:
- Create file AppDemo/Services/DiscountService.cs implementing IDiscountService.
- Expose methods: decimal CalculateDiscount(Book book, int quantity) and Task ApplyDiscountAsync(Book book).
- Use dependency injection: constructor takes IAppLogger and IBookService.
- Add XML documentation comments for public methods.
- Keep methods small and testable (each method <= 30 lines). For ApplyDiscountAsync, return Task.CompletedTask if no async work is required.
- Add a short xUnit test DiscountServiceTests.cs covering the happy path for CalculateDiscount.

Constraints:
- Target .NET 7 style (nullable enabled). Use simple, clear code.
- Avoid external services; keep all logic in-memory for tests.

Return:
- Full file contents for any new files and the unit test file.
- A one-line suggested commit message.
